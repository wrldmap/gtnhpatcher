# gtnhpatcher
Patcher i made for my gtnh run. Fork if you want i guess..
Currently targets GTNH 2.8.1

### How to use??!??!
Put the python file into your GTNH instance folder and run it. Should grab everything needed by itself. I suggest a new unlaunched instance :D

### How to update??!!?!?!
You don't. I couldn't get it to work, maybe later though.
